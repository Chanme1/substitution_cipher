# Substitution_cipher Decrypter

This program was created for a project in my Cryptography class. This program decrypts a substitution cipher by finding the frequency of each character in the ciphertext and a regular plaintext. It then matches each character based on their frequency. 
<p><b> For example: </b> If E appeared the most in the plaintext, and Z appeared the most in the ciphertext. Z is replaced with E in the decryption </p>

<p><b>Programming Language:</b> Python </p>
