ONE MORNING WHEN GREGOR SAMSA WOKE FROM TROUBLED DREAMS HE FOUND HIMSELF TRANSFORMED IN HIS BED INTO A HORRIBLE VERMIN HE LAY ON HIS ARMOURLIKE BACK AND IF HE LIFTED HIS HEAD A LITTLE HE COULD SEE HIS BROWN BELLY SLIGHTLY DOMED AND DIVIDED BY ARCHES INTO STIFF SECTIONS THE BEDDING WAS HARDLY ABLE TO COVER IT AND SEEMED READY TO SLIDE OFF ANY MOMENT HIS MANY LEGS PITIFULLY THIN COMPARED WITH THE SIZE OF THE REST OF HIM WAVED ABOUT HELPLESSLY AS HE LOOKEDWHATS HAPPENED TO ME HE THOUGHT IT WASNT A DREAM HIS ROOM A PROPER HUMAN ROOM ALTHOUGH A LITTLE TOO SMALL LAY PEACEFULLY BETWEEN ITS FOUR FAMILIAR WALLS A COLLECTION OF TEXTILE SAMPLES LAY SPREAD OUT ON THE TABLE  SAMSA WAS A TRAVELLING SALESMAN  AND ABOVE IT THERE HUNG A PICTURE THAT HE HAD RECENTLY CUT OUT OF AN ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE AND HOUSED IN A NICE GILDED FRAME IT SHOWED A LADY FITTED OUT WITH A FUR HAT AND FUR BOA WHO SAT UPRIGHT RAISING A HEAVY FUR MUFF THAT COVERED THE WHOLE OF HER LOWER ARM TOWARDS THE VIEWERGREGOR THEN TURNED TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AT THE DULL WEATHER DROPS OF RAIN COULD BE HEARD HITTING THE PANE WHICH MADE HIM FEEL QUITE SAD HOW ABOUT IF I SLEEP A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND FORGET ALL THIS NONSENSE HE THOUGHT BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING HE WAS UNABLE TO DO BECAUSE HE WAS USED TO SLEEPING ON HIS RIGHT AND IN HIS PRESENT STATE COULDNT GET INTO THAT POSITION HOWEVER HARD HE THREW HIMSELF ONTO HIS RIGHT HE ALWAYS ROLLED BACK TO WHERE HE WAS HE MUST HAVE TRIED IT A HUNDRED TIMES SHUT HIS EYES SO THAT HE WOULDNT HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FLOUNDERING LEGS AND ONLY STOPPED WHEN HE BEGAN TO FEEL A MILD DULL PAIN THERE THAT HE HAD NEVER FELT BEFOREOH GOD HE THOUGHT WHAT A STRENUOUS CAREER IT IS THAT IVE CHOSEN TRAVELLING DAY IN AND DAY OUT DOING BUSINESS LIKE THIS TAKES MUCH MORE EFFORT THAN DOING YOUR OWN BUSINESS AT HOME AND ON TOP OF THAT THERES THE CURSE OF TRAVELLING WORRIES ABOUT MAKING TRAIN CONNECTIONS BAD AND IRREGULAR FOOD CONTACT WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE ALL THE TIME SO THAT YOU CAN NEVER GET TO KNOW ANYONE OR BECOME FRIENDLY WITH THEM IT CAN ALL GO TO HELL HE FELT A SLIGHT ITCH UP ON HIS BELLY PUSHED HIMSELF SLOWLY UP ON HIS BACK TOWARDS THE HEADBOARD SO THAT HE COULD LIFT HIS HEAD BETTER FOUND WHERE THE ITCH WAS AND SAW THAT IT WAS COVERED WITH LOTS OF LITTLE WHITE SPOTS WHICH HE DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF AND WHEN HE TRIED TO FEEL THE PLACE WITH ONE OF HIS LEGS HE DREW IT QUICKLY BACK BECAUSE AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED IT HE WAS OVERCOME BY A COLD SHUDDERHE SLID BACK INTO HIS FORMER POSITION GETTING UP EARLY ALL THE TIME HE THOUGHT IT MAKES YOU STUPID YOUVE GOT TO GET ENOUGH SLEEP OTHER TRAVELLING SALESMEN LIVE A LIFE OF LUXURY FOR INSTANCE WHENEVER I GO BACK TO THE GUEST HOUSE DURING THE MORNING TO COPY OUT THE CONTRACT THESE GENTLEMEN ARE ALWAYS STILL SITTING THERE EATING THEIR BREAKFASTS I OUGHT TO JUST TRY THAT WITH MY BOSS ID GET KICKED OUT ON THE SPOT BUT WHO KNOWS MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING FOR ME IF I DIDNT HAVE MY PARENTS TO THINK ABOUT ID HAVE GIVEN IN MY NOTICE A LONG TIME AGO ID HAVE GONE UP TO THE BOSS AND TOLD HIM JUST WHAT I THINK TELL HIM EVERYTHING I WOULD LET HIM KNOW JUST WHAT I FEEL HED FALL RIGHT OFF HIS DESK AND ITS A FUNNY SORT OF BUSINESS TO BE SITTING UP THERE AT YOUR DESK TALKING DOWN AT YOUR SUBORDINATES FROM UP THERE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO RIGHT UP CLOSE BECAUSE THE BOSS IS HARD OF HEARING WELL THERES STILL SOME HOPE ONCE IVE GOT THE MONEY TOGETHER TO PAY OFF MY PARENTS DEBT TO HIM  ANOTHER FIVE OR SIX YEARS I SUPPOSE  THATS DEFINITELY WHAT ILL DO THATS WHEN ILL MAKE THE BIG CHANGE FIRST OF ALL THOUGH IVE GOT TO GET UP MY TRAIN LEAVES AT FIVEAND HE LOOKED OVER AT THE ALARM CLOCK TICKING ON THE CHEST OF DRAWERS GOD IN HEAVEN HE THOUGHT IT WAS HALF PAST SIX AND THE HANDS WERE QUIETLY MOVING FORWARDS IT WAS EVEN LATER THAN HALF PAST MORE LIKE QUARTER TO SEVEN HAD THE ALARM CLOCK NOT RUNG HE COULD SEE FROM THE BED THAT IT HAD BEEN SET FOR FOUR OCLOCK AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IT CERTAINLY MUST HAVE RUNG YES BUT WAS IT POSSIBLE TO QUIETLY SLEEP THROUGH THAT FURNITURERATTLING NOISE TRUE HE HAD NOT SLEPT PEACEFULLY BUT PROBABLY ALL THE MORE DEEPLY BECAUSE OF THAT WHAT SHOULD HE DO NOW THE NEXT TRAIN WENT AT SEVEN IF HE WERE TO CATCH THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO RUSH LIKE MAD AND THE COLLECTION OF SAMPLES WAS STILL NOT PACKED AND HE DID NOT AT ALL FEEL PARTICULARLY FRESH AND LIVELY AND EVEN IF HE DID CATCH THE TRAIN HE WOULD NOT AVOID HIS BOSSS ANGER AS THE OFFICE ASSISTANT WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE TO SEE THE FIVE OCLOCK TRAIN GO HE WOULD HAVE PUT IN HIS REPORT ABOUT GREGORS NOT BEING THERE A LONG TIME AGO THE OFFICE ASSISTANT WAS THE BOSSS MAN SPINELESS AND WITH NO UNDERSTANDING WHAT ABOUT IF HE REPORTED SICK BUT THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY STRAINED AND SUSPICIOUS AS IN FIFTEEN YEARS OF SERVICE GREGOR HAD NEVER ONCE YET BEEN ILL HIS BOSS WOULD CERTAINLY COME ROUND WITH THE DOCTOR FROM THE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANY ACCUSE HIS PARENTS OF HAVING A LAZY SON AND ACCEPT THE DOCTORS RECOMMENDATION NOT TO MAKE ANY CLAIM AS THE DOCTOR BELIEVED THAT NOONE WAS EVER ILL BUT THAT MANY WERE WORKSHY AND WHATS MORE WOULD HE HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY WRONG IN THIS CASE GREGOR DID IN FACT APART FROM EXCESSIVE SLEEPINESS AFTER SLEEPING FOR SO LONG FEEL COMPLETELY WELL AND EVEN FELT MUCH HUNGRIER THAN USUALHE WAS STILL HURRIEDLY THINKING ALL THIS THROUGH UNABLE TO DECIDE TO GET OUT OF THE BED WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK QUARTER TO SEVEN THERE WAS A CAUTIOUS KNOCK AT THE DOOR NEAR HIS HEAD GREGOR SOMEBODY CALLED  IT WAS HIS MOTHER  ITS QUARTER TO SEVEN DIDNT YOU WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE THAT GENTLE VOICE GREGOR WAS SHOCKED WHEN HE HEARD HIS OWN VOICE ANSWERING IT COULD HARDLY BE RECOGNISED AS THE VOICE HE HAD HAD BEFORE AS IF FROM DEEP INSIDE HIM THERE WAS A PAINFUL AND UNCONTROLLABLE SQUEAKING MIXED IN WITH IT THE WORDS COULD BE MADE OUT AT FIRST BUT THEN THERE WAS A SORT OF ECHO WHICH MADE THEM UNCLEAR LEAVING THE HEARER UNSURE WHETHER HE HAD HEARD PROPERLY OR NOT GREGOR HAD WANTED TO GIVE A FULL ANSWER AND EXPLAIN EVERYTHING BUT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING YES MOTHER YES THANKYOU IM GETTING UP NOW THE CHANGE IN GREGORS VOICE PROBABLY COULD NOT BE NOTICED OUTSIDE THROUGH THE WOODEN DOOR AS HIS MOTHER WAS SATISFIED WITH THIS EXPLANATION AND SHUFFLED AWAY BUT THIS SHORT CONVERSATION MADE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY AWARE THAT GREGOR AGAINST THEIR EXPECTATIONS WAS STILL AT HOME AND SOON HIS FATHER CAME KNOCKING AT ONE OF THE SIDE DOORS GENTLY BUT WITH HIS FIST GREGOR GREGOR HE CALLED WHATS WRONG AND AFTER A SHORT WHILE HE CALLED AGAIN WITH A WARNING DEEPNESS IN HIS VOICE GREGOR GREGOR AT THE OTHER SIDE DOOR HIS SISTER CAME PLAINTIVELY GREGOR ARENT YOU WELL DO YOU NEED ANYTHING GREGOR ANSWERED TO BOTH SIDES IM READY NOW MAKING AN EFFORT TO REMOVE ALL THE STRANGENESS FROM HIS VOICE BY ENUNCIATING VERY CAREFULLY AND PUTTING LONG PAUSES BETWEEN EACH INDIVIDUAL WORD HIS FATHER WENT BACK TO HIS BREAKFAST BUT HIS SISTER WHISPERED GREGOR OPEN THE DOOR I BEG OF YOU GREGOR HOWEVER HAD NO THOUGHT OF OPENING THE DOOR AND INSTEAD CONGRATULATED HIMSELF FOR HIS CAUTIOUS HABIT ACQUIRED FROM HIS TRAVELLING OF LOCKING ALL DOORS AT NIGHT EVEN WHEN HE WAS AT HOMETHE FIRST THING HE WANTED TO DO WAS TO GET UP IN PEACE WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED TO GET DRESSED AND MOST OF ALL TO HAVE HIS BREAKFAST ONLY THEN WOULD HE CONSIDER WHAT TO DO NEXT AS HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT HE WOULD NOT BRING HIS THOUGHTS TO ANY SENSIBLE CONCLUSIONS BY LYING IN BED HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD OFTEN FELT A SLIGHT PAIN IN BED PERHAPS CAUSED BY LYING AWKWARDLY BUT THAT HAD ALWAYS TURNED OUT TO BE PURE IMAGINATION AND HE WONDERED HOW HIS IMAGININGS WOULD SLOWLY RESOLVE THEMSELVES TODAY HE DID NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT THE CHANGE IN HIS VOICE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THE FIRST SIGN OF A SERIOUS COLD WHICH WAS AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD FOR TRAVELLING SALESMENIT WAS A SIMPLE MATTER TO THROW OFF THE COVERS HE ONLY HAD TO BLOW HIMSELF UP A LITTLE AND THEY FELL OFF BY THEMSELVES BUT IT BECAME DIFFICULT AFTER THAT ESPECIALLY AS HE WAS SO EXCEPTIONALLY BROAD HE WOULD HAVE USED HIS ARMS AND HIS HANDS TO PUSH HIMSELF UP BUT INSTEAD OF THEM HE ONLY HAD ALL THOSE LITTLE LEGS CONTINUOUSLY MOVING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND WHICH HE WAS MOREOVER UNABLE TO CONTROL IF HE WANTED TO BEND ONE OF THEM THEN THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT WOULD STRETCH ITSELF OUT AND IF HE FINALLY MANAGED TO DO WHAT HE WANTED WITH THAT LEG ALL THE OTHERS SEEMED TO BE SET FREE AND WOULD MOVE ABOUT PAINFULLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CANT BE DONE IN BED GREGOR SAID TO HIMSELF SO DONT KEEP TRYING TO DO ITTHE FIRST THING HE WANTED TO DO WAS GET THE LOWER PART OF HIS BODY OUT OF THE BED BUT HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS LOWER PART AND COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE IT TURNED OUT TO BE TOO HARD TO MOVE IT WENT SO SLOWLY AND FINALLY ALMOST IN A FRENZY WHEN HE CARELESSLY SHOVED HIMSELF FORWARDS WITH ALL THE FORCE HE COULD GATHER HE CHOSE THE WRONG DIRECTION HIT HARD AGAINST THE LOWER BEDPOST AND LEARNED FROM THE BURNING PAIN HE FELT THAT THE LOWER PART OF HIS BODY MIGHT WELL AT PRESENT BE THE MOST SENSITIVESO THEN HE TRIED TO GET THE TOP PART OF HIS BODY OUT OF THE BED FIRST CAREFULLY TURNING HIS HEAD TO THE SIDE THIS HE MANAGED QUITE EASILY AND DESPITE ITS BREADTH AND ITS WEIGHT THE BULK OF HIS BODY EVENTUALLY FOLLOWED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HEAD BUT WHEN HE HAD AT LAST GOT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE BED AND INTO THE FRESH AIR IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF HE LET HIMSELF FALL IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IF HIS HEAD WERE NOT INJURED SO HE BECAME AFRAID TO CARRY ON PUSHING HIMSELF FORWARD THE SAME WAY AND HE COULD NOT KNOCK HIMSELF OUT NOW AT ANY PRICE BETTER TO STAY IN BED THAN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESSIT TOOK JUST AS MUCH EFFORT TO GET BACK TO WHERE HE HAD BEEN EARLIER BUT WHEN HE LAY THERE SIGHING AND WAS ONCE MORE WATCHING HIS LEGS AS THEY STRUGGLED AGAINST EACH OTHER EVEN HARDER THAN BEFORE IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF BRINGING PEACE AND ORDER TO THIS CHAOS HE TOLD HIMSELF ONCE MORE THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY IN BED AND THAT THE MOST SENSIBLE THING TO DO WOULD BE TO GET FREE OF IT IN WHATEVER WAY HE COULD AT WHATEVER SACRIFICE AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH HE DID NOT FORGET TO REMIND HIMSELF THAT CALM CONSIDERATION WAS MUCH BETTER THAN RUSHING TO DESPERATE CONCLUSIONS AT TIMES LIKE THIS HE WOULD DIRECT HIS EYES TO THE WINDOW AND LOOK OUT AS CLEARLY AS HE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NARROW STREET WAS ENVELOPED IN MORNING FOG AND THE VIEW HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE OR CHEER TO OFFER HIM SEVEN OCLOCK ALREADY HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK AGAIN SEVEN OCLOCK AND THERES STILL A FOG LIKE THIS AND HE LAY THERE QUIETLY A WHILE LONGER BREATHING LIGHTLY AS IF HE PERHAPS EXPECTED THE TOTAL STILLNESS TO BRING THINGS BACK TO THEIR REAL AND NATURAL STATEBUT THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF BEFORE IT STRIKES QUARTER PAST SEVEN ILL DEFINITELY HAVE TO HAVE GOT PROPERLY OUT OF BED AND BY THEN SOMEBODY WILL HAVE COME ROUND FROM WORK TO ASK WHATS HAPPENED TO ME AS WELL AS THEY OPEN UP AT WORK BEFORE SEVEN OCLOCK AND SO HE SET HIMSELF TO THE TASK OF SWINGING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF HIS BODY OUT OF THE BED ALL AT THE SAME TIME IF HE SUCCEEDED IN FALLING OUT OF BED IN THIS WAY AND KEPT HIS HEAD RAISED AS HE DID SO HE COULD PROBABLY AVOID INJURING IT HIS BACK SEEMED TO BE QUITE HARD AND PROBABLY NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO IT FALLING ONTO THE CARPET HIS MAIN CONCERN WAS FOR THE LOUD NOISE HE WAS BOUND TO MAKE AND WHICH EVEN THROUGH ALL THE DOORS WOULD PROBABLY RAISE CONCERN IF NOT ALARM BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE RISKEDWHEN GREGOR WAS ALREADY STICKING HALF WAY OUT OF THE BED  THE NEW METHOD WAS MORE OF A GAME THAN AN EFFORT ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS ROCK BACK AND FORTH  IT OCCURRED TO HIM HOW SIMPLE EVERYTHING WOULD BE IF SOMEBODY CAME TO HELP HIM TWO STRONG PEOPLE  HE HAD HIS FATHER AND THE MAID IN MIND  WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE TO PUSH THEIR ARMS UNDER THE DOME OF HIS BACK PEEL HIM AWAY FROM THE BED BEND DOWN WITH THE LOAD AND THEN BE PATIENT AND CAREFUL AS HE SWANG OVER ONTO THE FLOOR WHERE HOPEFULLY THE LITTLE LEGS WOULD FIND A USE SHOULD HE REALLY CALL FOR HELP THOUGH EVEN APART FROM THE FACT THAT ALL THE DOORS WERE LOCKED DESPITE ALL THE DIFFICULTY HE WAS IN HE COULD NOT SUPPRESS A SMILE AT THIS THOUGHTAFTER A WHILE HE HAD ALREADY MOVED SO FAR ACROSS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD FOR HIM TO KEEP HIS BALANCE IF HE ROCKED TOO HARD THE TIME WAS NOW TEN PAST SEVEN AND HE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION VERY SOON THEN THERE WAS A RING AT THE DOOR OF THE FLAT THATLL BE SOMEONE FROM WORK HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND FROZE VERY STILL ALTHOUGH HIS LITTLE LEGS ONLY BECAME ALL THE MORE LIVELY AS THEY DANCED AROUND FOR A MOMENT EVERYTHING REMAINED QUIET THEYRE NOT OPENING THE DOOR GREGOR SAID TO HIMSELF CAUGHT IN SOME NONSENSICAL HOPE BUT THEN OF COURSE THE MAIDS FIRM STEPS WENT TO THE DOOR AS EVER AND OPENED IT GREGOR ONLY NEEDED TO HEAR THE VISITORS FIRST WORDS OF GREETING AND HE KNEW WHO IT WAS  THE CHIEF CLERK HIMSELF WHY DID GREGOR HAVE TO BE THE ONLY ONE CONDEMNED TO WORK FOR A COMPANY WHERE THEY IMMEDIATELY BECAME HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS AT THE SLIGHTEST SHORTCOMING WERE ALL EMPLOYEES EVERY ONE OF THEM LOUTS WAS THERE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO WAS FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED WHO WOULD GO SO MAD WITH PANGS OF CONSCIENCE THAT HE COULDNT GET OUT OF BED IF HE DIDNT SPEND AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HOURS IN THE MORNING ON COMPANY BUSINESS WAS IT REALLY NOT ENOUGH TO LET ONE OF THE TRAINEES MAKE ENQUIRIES  ASSUMING ENQUIRIES WERE EVEN NECESSARY  DID THE CHIEF CLERK HAVE TO COME HIMSELF AND DID THEY HAVE TO SHOW THE WHOLE INNOCENT FAMILY THAT THIS WAS SO SUSPICIOUS THAT ONLY THE CHIEF CLERK COULD BE TRUSTED TO HAVE THE WISDOM TO INVESTIGATE IT AND MORE BECAUSE THESE THOUGHTS HAD MADE HIM UPSET THAN THROUGH ANY PROPER DECISION HE SWANG HIMSELF WITH ALL HIS FORCE OUT OF THE BED THERE WAS A LOUD THUMP BUT IT WASNT REALLY A LOUD NOISE HIS FALL WAS SOFTENED A LITTLE BY THE CARPET AND GREGORS BACK WAS ALSO MORE ELASTIC THAN HE HAD THOUGHT WHICH MADE THE SOUND MUFFLED AND NOT TOO NOTICEABLE HE HAD NOT HELD HIS HEAD CAREFULLY ENOUGH THOUGH AND HIT IT AS HE FELL ANNOYED AND IN PAIN HE TURNED IT AND RUBBED IT AGAINST THE CARPETSOMETHINGS FALLEN DOWN IN THERE SAID THE CHIEF CLERK IN THE ROOM ON THE LEFT GREGOR TRIED TO IMAGINE WHETHER SOMETHING OF THE SORT THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM TODAY COULD EVER HAPPEN TO THE CHIEF CLERK TOO YOU HAD TO CONCEDE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT AS IF IN GRUFF REPLY TO THIS QUESTION THE CHIEF CLERKS FIRM FOOTSTEPS IN HIS HIGHLY POLISHED BOOTS COULD NOW BE HEARD IN THE ADJOINING ROOM FROM THE ROOM ON HIS RIGHT GREGORS SISTER WHISPERED TO HIM TO LET HIM KNOW GREGOR THE CHIEF CLERK IS HERE YES I KNOW SAID GREGOR TO HIMSELF BUT WITHOUT DARING TO RAISE HIS VOICE LOUD ENOUGH FOR HIS SISTER TO HEAR HIMGREGOR SAID HIS FATHER NOW FROM THE ROOM TO HIS LEFT THE CHIEF CLERK HAS COME ROUND AND WANTS TO KNOW WHY YOU DIDNT LEAVE ON THE EARLY TRAIN WE DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM AND ANYWAY HE WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU PERSONALLY SO PLEASE OPEN UP THIS DOOR IM SURE HELL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO FORGIVE THE UNTIDINESS OF YOUR ROOM THEN THE CHIEF CLERK CALLED GOOD MORNING MR SAMSA HE ISNT WELL SAID HIS MOTHER TO THE CHIEF CLERK WHILE HIS FATHER CONTINUED TO SPEAK THROUGH THE DOOR HE ISNT WELL PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHY ELSE WOULD GREGOR HAVE MISSED A TRAIN THE LAD ONLY EVER THINKS ABOUT THE BUSINESS IT NEARLY MAKES ME CROSS THE WAY HE NEVER GOES OUT IN THE EVENINGS HES BEEN IN TOWN FOR A WEEK NOW BUT STAYED HOME EVERY EVENING HE SITS WITH US IN THE KITCHEN AND JUST READS THE PAPER OR STUDIES TRAIN TIMETABLES HIS IDEA OF RELAXATION IS WORKING WITH HIS FRETSAW HES MADE A LITTLE FRAME FOR INSTANCE IT ONLY TOOK HIM TWO OR THREE EVENINGS YOULL BE AMAZED HOW NICE IT IS ITS HANGING UP IN HIS ROOM YOULL SEE IT AS SOON AS GREGOR OPENS THE DOOR ANYWAY IM GLAD YOURE HERE WE WOULDNT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET GREGOR TO OPEN THE DOOR BY OURSELVES HES SO STUBBORN AND IM SURE HE ISNT WELL HE SAID THIS MORNING THAT HE IS BUT HE ISNT ILL BE THERE IN A MOMENT SAID GREGOR SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY BUT WITHOUT MOVING SO THAT HE WOULD NOT MISS ANY WORD OF THE CONVERSATION WELL I CANT THINK OF ANY OTHER WAY OF EXPLAINING IT MRS SAMSA SAID THE CHIEF CLERK I HOPE ITS NOTHING SERIOUS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I MUST SAY THAT IF WE PEOPLE IN COMMERCE EVER BECOME SLIGHTLY UNWELL THEN FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU LIKE WE SIMPLY HAVE TO OVERCOME IT BECAUSE OF BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS CAN THE CHIEF CLERK COME IN TO SEE YOU NOW THEN ASKED HIS FATHER IMPATIENTLY KNOCKING AT THE DOOR AGAIN NO SAID GREGOR IN THE ROOM ON HIS RIGHT THERE FOLLOWED A PAINFUL SILENCE IN THE ROOM ON HIS LEFT HIS SISTER BEGAN TO CRYSO WHY DID HIS SISTER NOT GO AND JOIN THE OTHERS SHE HAD PROBABLY ONLY JUST GOT UP AND HAD NOT EVEN BEGUN TO GET DRESSED AND WHY WAS SHE CRYING WAS IT BECAUSE HE HAD NOT GOT UP AND HAD NOT LET THE CHIEF CLERK IN BECAUSE HE WAS IN DANGER OF LOSING HIS JOB AND IF THAT HAPPENED HIS BOSS WOULD ONCE MORE PURSUE THEIR PARENTS WITH THE SAME DEMANDS AS BEFORE THERE WAS NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT YET GREGOR WAS STILL THERE AND HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF ABANDONING HIS FAMILY FOR THE TIME BEING HE JUST LAY THERE ON THE CARPET AND NOONE WHO KNEW THE CONDITION HE WAS IN WOULD SERIOUSLY HAVE EXPECTED HIM TO LET THE CHIEF CLERK IN IT WAS ONLY A MINOR DISCOURTESY AND A SUITABLE EXCUSE COULD EASILY BE FOUND FOR IT LATER ON IT WAS NOT SOMETHING FOR WHICH GREGOR COULD BE SACKED ON THE SPOT AND IT SEEMED TO GREGOR MUCH MORE SENSIBLE TO LEAVE HIM NOW IN PEACE INSTEAD OF DISTURBING HIM WITH TALKING AT HIM AND CRYING BUT THE OTHERS DIDNT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING THEY WERE WORRIED THAT WOULD EXCUSE THEIR BEHAVIOURTHE CHIEF CLERK NOW RAISED HIS VOICE MR SAMSA HE CALLED TO HIM WHAT IS WRONG YOU BARRICADE YOURSELF IN YOUR ROOM GIVE US NO MORE THAN YES OR NO FOR AN ANSWER YOU ARE CAUSING SERIOUS AND UNNECESSARY CONCERN TO YOUR PARENTS AND YOU FAIL  AND I MENTION THIS JUST BY THE WAY  YOU FAIL TO CARRY OUT YOUR BUSINESS DUTIES IN A WAY THAT IS QUITE UNHEARD OF IM SPEAKING HERE ON BEHALF OF YOUR PARENTS AND OF YOUR EMPLOYER AND REALLY MUST REQUEST A

DONT NEED TO WAIT SIR ILL BE IN THE OFFICE SOON AFTER YOU AND PLEASE BE SO GOOD AS TO TELL THAT TO THE BOSS AND RECOMMEND ME TO HIMAND WHILE GREGOR GUSHED OUT THESE WORDS HARDLY KNOWING WHAT HE WAS SAYING HE MADE HIS WAY OVER TO THE CHEST OF DRAWERS  THIS WAS EASILY DONE PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE PRACTISE HE HAD ALREADY HAD IN BED  WHERE HE NOW TRIED TO GET HIMSELF UPRIGHT HE REALLY DID WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR REALLY DID WANT TO LET THEM SEE HIM AND TO SPEAK WITH THE CHIEF CLERK THE OTHERS WERE BEING SO INSISTENT AND HE WAS CURIOUS TO LEARN WHAT THEY WOULD SAY WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM IF THEY WERE SHOCKED THEN IT WOULD NO LONGER BE GREGORS RESPONSIBILITY AND HE COULD REST IF HOWEVER THEY TOOK EVERYTHING CALMLY HE WOULD STILL HAVE NO REASON TO BE UPSET AND IF HE HURRIED HE REALLY COULD BE AT THE STATION FOR EIGHT OCLOCK THE FIRST FEW TIMES HE TRIED TO CLIMB UP ON THE SMOOTH CHEST OF DRAWERS HE JUST SLID DOWN AGAIN BUT HE FINALLY GAVE HIMSELF ONE LAST SWING AND STOOD THERE UPRIGHT THE LOWER PART OF HIS BODY WAS IN SERIOUS PAIN BUT HE NO LONGER GAVE ANY ATTENTION TO IT NOW HE LET HIMSELF FALL AGAINST THE BACK OF A NEARBY CHAIR AND HELD TIGHTLY TO THE EDGES OF IT WITH HIS LITTLE LEGS BY NOW HE HAD ALSO CALMED DOWN AND KEPT QUIET SO THAT HE COULD LISTEN TO WHAT THE CHIEF CLERK WAS SAYINGDID YOU UNDERSTAND A WORD OF ALL THAT THE CHIEF CLERK ASKED HIS PARENTS SURELY HES NOT TRYING TO MAKE FOOLS OF US OH GOD CALLED HIS MOTHER WHO WAS ALREADY IN TEARS HE COULD BE SERIOUSLY ILL AND WERE MAKING HIM SUFFER GRETE GRETE SHE THEN CRIED MOTHER HIS SISTER CALLED FROM THE OTHER SIDE THEY COMMUNICATED ACROSS GREGORS ROOM YOULL HAVE TO GO FOR THE DOCTOR STRAIGHT AWAY GREGOR IS ILL QUICK GET THE DOCTOR DID YOU HEAR THE WAY GREGOR SPOKE JUST NOW THAT WAS THE VOICE OF AN ANIMAL SAID THE CHIEF CLERK WITH A CALMNESS THAT WAS IN CONTRAST WITH HIS MOTHERS SCREAMS ANNA ANNA HIS FATHER CALLED INTO THE KITCHEN THROUGH THE ENTRANCE HALL CLAPPING HIS HANDS GET A LOCKSMITH HERE NOW AND THE TWO GIRLS THEIR SKIRTS SWISHING IMMEDIATELY RAN OUT THROUGH THE HALL WRENCHING OPEN THE FRONT DOOR OF THE FLAT AS THEY WENT HOW HAD HIS SISTER MANAGED TO GET DRESSED SO QUICKLY THERE WAS NO SOUND OF THE DOOR BANGING SHUT AGAIN THEY MUST HAVE LEFT IT OPEN PEOPLE OFTEN DO IN HOMES WHERE SOMETHING AWFUL HAS HAPPENEDGREGOR IN CONTRAST HAD BECOME MUCH CALMER SO THEY COULDNT UNDERSTAND HIS WORDS ANY MORE ALTHOUGH THEY SEEMED CLEAR ENOUGH TO HIM CLEARER THAN BEFORE  PERHAPS HIS EARS HAD BECOME USED TO THE SOUND THEY HAD REALISED THOUGH THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM AND WERE READY TO HELP THE FIRST RESPONSE TO HIS SITUATION HAD BEEN CONFIDENT AND WISE AND THAT MADE HIM FEEL BETTER HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN DRAWN BACK IN AMONG PEOPLE AND FROM THE DOCTOR AND THE LOCKSMITH HE EXPECTED GREAT AND SURPRISING ACHIEVEMENTS  ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT REALLY DISTINGUISH ONE FROM THE OTHER WHATEVER WAS SAID NEXT WOULD BE CRUCIAL SO IN ORDER TO MAKE HIS VOICE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE HE COUGHED A LITTLE BUT TAKING CARE TO DO THIS NOT TOO LOUDLY AS EVEN THIS MIGHT WELL SOUND DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THAT A HUMAN COUGHS AND HE WAS NO LONGER SURE HE COULD JUDGE THIS FOR HIMSELF MEANWHILE IT HAD BECOME VERY QUIET IN THE NEXT ROOM PERHAPS HIS PARENTS WERE SAT AT THE TABLE WHISPERING WITH THE CHIEF CLERK OR PERHAPS THEY WERE ALL PRESSED AGAINST THE DOOR AND LISTENINGGREGOR SLOWLY PUSHED HIS WAY OVER TO THE DOOR WITH THE CHAIR ONCE THERE HE LET GO OF IT AND THREW HIMSELF ONTO THE DOOR HOLDING HIMSELF UPRIGHT AGAINST IT USING THE ADHESIVE ON THE TIPS OF HIS LEGS HE RESTED THERE A LITTLE WHILE TO RECOVER FROM THE EFFORT INVOLVED AND THEN SET HIMSELF TO THE TASK OF TURNING THE KEY IN THE LOCK WITH HIS MOUTH HE SEEMED UNFORTUNATELY TO HAVE NO PROPER TEETH  HOW WAS HE THEN TO GRASP THE KEY  BUT THE LACK OF TEETH WAS OF COURSE MADE UP FOR WITH A VERY STRONG JAW USING THE JAW HE REALLY WAS ABLE TO START THE KEY TURNING IGNORING THE FACT THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN CAUSING SOME KIND OF DAMAGE AS A BROWN FLUID CAME FROM HIS MOUTH FLOWED OVER THE KEY AND DRIPPED ONTO THE FLOOR LISTEN SAID THE CHIEF CLERK IN THE NEXT ROOM HES TURNING THE KEY GREGOR WAS GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS BUT THEY ALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLING TO HIM HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER TOO WELL DONE GREGOR THEY SHOULD HAVE CRIED KEEP AT IT KEEP HOLD OF THE LOCK AND WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE ALL EXCITEDLY FOLLOWING HIS EFFORTS HE BIT ON THE KEY WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE PAIN HE WAS CAUSING HIMSELF AS THE KEY TURNED ROUND HE TURNED AROUND THE LOCK WITH IT ONLY HOLDING HIMSELF UPRIGHT WITH HIS MOUTH AND HUNG ONTO THE KEY OR PUSHED IT DOWN AGAIN WITH THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF HIS BODY AS NEEDED THE CLEAR SOUND OF THE LOCK AS IT SNAPPED BACK WAS GREGORS SIGN THAT HE COULD BREAK HIS CONCENTRATION AND AS HE REGAINED HIS BREATH HE SAID TO HIMSELF SO I DIDNT NEED THE LOCKSMITH AFTER ALL THEN HE LAY HIS HEAD ON THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR TO OPEN IT COMPLETELYBECAUSE HE HAD TO OPEN THE DOOR IN THIS WAY IT WAS ALREADY WIDE OPEN BEFORE HE COULD BE SEEN HE HAD FIRST TO SLOWLY TURN HIMSELF AROUND ONE OF THE DOUBLE DOORS AND HE HAD TO DO IT VERY CAREFULLY IF HE DID NOT WANT TO FALL FLAT ON HIS BACK BEFORE ENTERING THE ROOM HE WAS STILL OCCUPIED WITH THIS DIFFICULT MOVEMENT UNABLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING ELSE WHEN HE HEARD THE CHIEF CLERK EXCLAIM A LOUD OH WHICH SOUNDED LIKE THE SOUGHING OF THE WIND NOW HE ALSO SAW HIM  HE WAS THE NEAREST TO THE DOOR  HIS HAND PRESSED AGAINST HIS OPEN MOUTH AND SLOWLY RETREATING AS IF DRIVEN BY A STEADY AND INVISIBLE FORCE GREGORS MOTHER HER HAIR STILL DISHEVELLED FROM BED DESPITE THE CHIEF CLERKS BEING THERE LOOKED AT HIS FATHER THEN SHE UNFOLDED HER ARMS TOOK TWO STEPS FORWARD TOWARDS GREGOR AND SANK DOWN ONTO THE FLOOR INTO HER SKIRTS THAT SPREAD THEMSELVES OUT AROUND HER AS HER HEAD DISAPPEARED DOWN ONTO HER BREAST HIS FATHER LOOKED HOSTILE AND CLENCHED HIS FISTS AS IF WANTING TO KNOCK GREGOR BACK INTO HIS ROOM THEN HE LOOKED UNCERTAINLY ROUND THE LIVING ROOM COVERED HIS EYES WITH HIS HANDS AND WEPT SO THAT HIS POWERFUL CHEST SHOOKSO GREGOR DID NOT GO INTO THE ROOM BUT LEANT AGAINST THE INSIDE OF THE OTHER DOOR WHICH WAS STILL HELD BOLTED IN PLACE IN THIS WAY ONLY HALF OF HIS BODY COULD BE SEEN ALONG WITH HIS HEAD ABOVE IT WHICH HE LEANT OVER TO ONE SIDE AS HE PEERED OUT AT THE OTHERS MEANWHILE THE DAY HAD BECOME MUCH LIGHTER PART OF THE ENDLESS GREYBLACK BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET  WHICH WAS A HOSPITAL  COULD BE SEEN QUITE CLEARLY WITH THE AUSTERE AND REGULAR LINE OF WINDOWS PIERCING ITS FAADE THE RAIN WAS STILL FALLING NOW THROWING DOWN LARGE INDIVIDUAL DROPLETS WHICH HIT THE GROUND ONE AT A TIME THE WASHING UP FROM BREAKFAST LAY ON THE TABLE THERE WAS SO MUCH OF IT BECAUSE FOR GREGORS FATHER BREAKFAST WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY AND HE WOULD STRETCH IT OUT FOR SEVERAL HOURS AS HE SAT READING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NEWSPAPERS ON THE WALL EXACTLY OPPOSITE THERE WAS PHOTOGRAPH OF GREGOR WHEN HE WAS A LIEUTENANT IN THE ARMY HIS SWORD IN HIS HAND AND A CAREFREE SMILE ON HIS FACE AS HE CALLED FORTH RESPECT FOR HIS UNIFORM AND BEARING THE DOOR TO THE ENTRANCE HALL WAS OPEN AND AS THE FRONT DOOR OF THE FLAT WAS ALSO OPEN HE COULD SEE ONTO THE LANDING AND THE STAIRS WHERE THEY BEGAN THEIR WAY DOWN BELOWNOW THEN SAID GREGOR WELL AWARE THAT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE KEPT CALM ILL GET DRESSED STRAIGHT AWAY NOW PACK UP MY SAMPLES AND SET OFF WILL YOU PLEASE JUST LET ME LEAVE YOU CAN SEE HE SAID TO THE CHIEF CLERK THAT IM NOT STUBBORN AND I LIKE TO DO MY JOB BEING A COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER IS ARDUOUS BUT WITHOUT TRAVELLING I COULDNT EARN MY LIVING SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING IN TO THE OFFICE YES WILL YOU REPORT EVERYTHING ACCURATELY THEN ITS QUITE POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE TO BE TEMPORARILY UNABLE TO WORK BUT THATS JUST THE RIGHT TIME TO REMEMBER WHATS BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE PAST AND CONSIDER THAT LATER ON ONCE THE DIFFICULTY HAS BEEN REMOVED HE WILL CERTAINLY WORK WITH ALL THE MORE DILIGENCE AND CONCENTRATION YOURE WELL AWARE THAT IM SERIOUSLY IN DEBT TO OUR EMPLOYER AS WELL AS HAVING TO LOOK AFTER MY PARENTS AND MY SISTER SO THAT IM TRAPPED IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION BUT I WILL WORK MY WAY OUT OF IT AGAIN PLEASE DONT MAKE THINGS ANY HARDER FOR ME THAN THEY ARE ALREADY AND DONT TAKE SIDES AGAINST ME AT THE OFFICE I KNOW THAT NOBODY LIKES THE TRAVELLERS THEY THINK WE EARN AN ENORMOUS WAGE AS WELL AS HAVING A SOFT TIME OF IT THATS JUST PREJUDICE BUT THEY HAVE NO PARTICULAR REASON TO THINK BETTER OF IT BUT YOU SIR YOU HAVE A BETTER OVERVIEW THAN THE REST OF THE STAFF IN FACT IF I CAN SAY THIS IN CONFIDENCE A BETTER OVERVIEW THAN THE BOSS HIMSELF  ITS VERY EASY FOR A BUSINESSMAN LIKE HIM TO MAKE MISTAKES ABOUT HIS EMPLOYEES AND JUDGE THEM MORE HARSHLY THAN HE SHOULD AND YOURE ALSO WELL AWARE THAT WE TRAVELLERS SPEND ALMOST THE WHOLE YEAR AWAY FROM THE OFFICE SO THAT WE CAN VERY EASILY FALL VICTIM TO GOSSIP AND CHANCE AND GROUNDLESS COMPLAINTS AND ITS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEND YOURSELF FROM THAT SORT OF THING WE DONT USUALLY EVEN HEAR ABOUT THEM OR IF AT ALL ITS WHEN WE ARRIVE BACK HOME EXHAUSTED FROM A TRIP AND THATS WHEN WE FEEL THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF WHATS BEEN GOING ON WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING WHAT CAUSED THEM PLEASE DONT GO AWAY AT LEAST FIRST SAY SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT YOU GRANT THAT IM AT LEAST PARTLY RIGHTBUT THE CHIEF CLERK HAD TURNED AWAY AS SOON AS GREGOR HAD STARTED TO SPEAK AND WITH PROTRUDING LIPS ONLY STARED BACK AT HIM OVER HIS TREMBLING SHOULDERS AS HE LEFT HE DID NOT KEEP STILL FOR A MOMENT WHILE GREGOR WAS SPEAKING BUT MOVED STEADILY TOWARDS THE DOOR WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES OFF HIM HE MOVED VERY GRADUALLY AS IF THERE HAD BEEN SOME SECRET PROHIBITION ON LEAVING THE ROOM IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE ENTRANCE HALL THAT HE MADE A SUDDEN MOVEMENT DREW HIS FOOT FROM THE LIVING ROOM AND RUSHED FORWARD IN A PANIC IN THE HALL HE STRETCHED HIS RIGHT HAND FAR OUT TOWARDS THE STAIRWAY AS IF OUT THERE THERE WERE SOME SUPERNATURAL FORCE WAITING TO SAVE HIMGREGOR REALISED THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO LET THE CHIEF CLERK GO AWAY IN THIS MOOD IF HIS POSITION IN THE FIRM WAS NOT TO BE PUT INTO EXTREME DANGER THAT WAS SOMETHING HIS PARENTS DID NOT UNDERSTAND VERY WELL OVER THE YEARS THEY HAD BECOME CONVINCED THAT THIS JOB WOULD PROVIDE FOR GREGOR FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND BESIDES THEY HAD SO MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT AT PRESENT THAT THEY HAD LOST SIGHT OF ANY THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE GREGOR THOUGH DID THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE THE CHIEF CLERK HAD TO BE HELD BACK CALMED DOWN CONVINCED AND FINALLY WON OVER THE FUTURE OF GREGOR AND HIS FAMILY DEPENDED ON IT IF ONLY HIS SISTER WERE HERE SHE WAS CLEVER SHE WAS ALREADY IN TEARS WHILE GREGOR WAS STILL LYING PEACEFULLY ON HIS BACK AND THE CHIEF CLERK WAS A LOVER OF WOMEN SURELY SHE COULD PERSUADE HIM SHE WOULD CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR IN THE ENTRANCE HALL AND TALK HIM OUT OF HIS SHOCKED STATE BUT HIS SISTER WAS NOT THERE GREGOR WOULD HAVE TO DO THE JOB HIMSELF AND WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT HE STILL WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH HOW WELL HE COULD MOVE ABOUT IN HIS PRESENT STATE OR THAT HIS SPEECH STILL MIGHT NOT  OR PROBABLY WOULD NOT  BE UNDERSTOOD HE LET GO OF THE DOOR PUSHED HIMSELF THROUGH THE OPENING TRIED TO REACH THE CHIEF CLERK ON THE LANDING WHO RIDICULOUSLY WAS HOLDING ON TO THE BANISTER WITH BOTH HANDS BUT GREGOR FELL IMMEDIATELY OVER AND WITH A LITTLE SCREAM AS HE SOUGHT SOMETHING TO HOLD ONTO LANDED ON HIS NUMEROUS LITTLE LEGS HARDLY HAD THAT HAPPENED THAN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY HE BEGAN TO FEEL ALRIGHT WITH HIS BODY THE LITTLE LEGS HAD THE SOLID GROUND UNDER THEM TO HIS PLEASURE THEY DID EXACTLY AS HE TOLD THEM THEY WERE EVEN MAKING THE EFFORT TO CARRY HIM WHERE HE WANTED TO GO AND HE WAS SOON BELIEVING THAT ALL HIS SORROWS WOULD SOON BE FINALLY AT AN END HE HELD BACK THE URGE TO MOVE BUT SWAYED FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS HE CROUCHED THERE ON THE FLOOR HIS MOTHER WAS NOT FAR AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM AND SEEMED AT FIRST QUITE ENGROSSED IN HERSELF BUT THEN SHE SUDDENLY JUMPED UP WITH HER ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND HER FINGERS SPREAD SHOUTING HELP FOR PITYS SAKE HELP THE WAY SHE HELD HER HEAD SUGGESTED SHE WANTED TO SEE GREGOR BETTER BUT THE UNTHINKING WAY SHE WAS HURRYING BACKWARDS SHOWED THAT SHE DID NOT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT THE TABLE WAS BEHIND HER WITH ALL THE BREAKFAST THINGS ON IT WHEN SHE REACHED THE TABLE SHE SAT QUICKLY DOWN ON IT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS DOING WITHOUT EVEN SEEMING TO NOTICE THAT THE COFFEE POT HAD BEEN KNOCKED OVER AND A GUSH OF COFFEE WAS POURING DOWN ONTO THE CARPETMOTHER MOTHER SAID GREGOR GENTLY LOOKING UP AT HER HE HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN THE CHIEF CLERK FOR THE MOMENT BUT COULD NOT HELP HIMSELF SNAPPING IN THE AIR WITH HIS JAWS AT THE SIGHT OF THE FLOW OF COFFEE THAT SET HIS MOTHER SCREAMING ANEW SHE FLED FROM THE TABLE AND INTO THE ARMS OF HIS FATHER AS HE RUSHED TOWARDS HER GREGOR THOUGH HAD NO TIME TO SPARE FOR HIS PARENTS NOW THE CHIEF CLERK HAD ALREADY REACHED THE STAIRS WITH HIS CHIN ON THE BANISTER HE LOOKED BACK FOR THE LAST TIME GREGOR MADE A RUN FOR HIM HE WANTED TO BE SURE OF REACHING HIM THE CHIEF CLERK MUST HAVE EXPECTED SOMETHING AS HE LEAPT DOWN SEVERAL STEPS AT ONCE AND DISAPPEARED HIS SHOUTS RESOUNDING ALL AROUND THE STAIRCASE THE FLIGHT OF THE CHIEF CLERK SEEMED UNFORTUNATELY TO PUT GREGORS FATHER INTO A PANIC AS WELL UNTIL THEN HE HAD BEEN RELATIVELY SELF CONTROLLED BUT NOW INSTEAD OF RUNNING AFTER THE CHIEF CLERK HIMSELF OR AT LEAST NOT IMPEDING GREGOR AS HE RAN AFTER HIM GREGORS FATHER SEIZED THE CHIEF CLERKS STICK IN HIS RIGHT HAND THE CHIEF CLERK HAD LEFT IT BEHIND ON A CHAIR ALONG WITH HIS HAT AND OVERCOAT PICKED UP A LARGE NEWSPAPER FROM THE TABLE WITH HIS LEFT AND USED THEM TO DRIVE GREGOR BACK INTO HIS ROOM STAMPING HIS FOOT AT HIM AS HE WENT GREGORS APPEALS TO HIS FATHER WERE OF NO HELP HIS APPEALS WERE SIMPLY NOT UNDERSTOOD HOWEVER MUCH HE HUMBLY TURNED HIS HEAD HIS FATHER MERELY STAMPED HIS FOOT ALL THE HARDER ACROSS THE ROOM DESPITE THE CHILLY WEATHER GREGORS MOTHER HAD PULLED OPEN A WINDOW LEANT FAR OUT OF IT AND PRESSED HER HANDS TO HER FACE A STRONG DRAUGHT OF AIR FLEW IN FROM THE STREET TOWARDS THE STAIRWAY THE CURTAINS FLEW UP THE NEWSPAPERS ON THE TABLE FLUTTERED AND SOME OF THEM WERE BLOWN ONTO THE FLOOR NOTHING WOULD STOP GREGORS FATHER AS HE DROVE HIM BACK MAKING HISSING NOISES AT HIM LIKE A WILD MAN GREGOR HAD NEVER HAD ANY PRACTICE IN MOVING BACKWARDS AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO GO VERY SLOWLY IF GREGOR HAD ONLY BEEN ALLOWED TO TURN ROUND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK IN HIS ROOM STRAIGHT AWAY BUT HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF HE TOOK THE TIME TO DO THAT HIS FATHER WOULD BECOME IMPATIENT AND THERE WAS THE THREAT OF A LETHAL BLOW TO HIS BACK OR HEAD FROM THE STICK IN HIS FATHERS HAND ANY MOMENT EVENTUALLY THOUGH GREGOR REALISED THAT HE HAD NO CHOICE AS HE SAW TO HIS DISGUST THAT HE WAS QUITE INCAPABLE OF GOING BACKWARDS IN A STRAIGHT LINE SO HE BEGAN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND WITH FREQUENT ANXIOUS GLANCES AT HIS FATHER TO TURN HIMSELF ROUND IT WENT VERY SLOWLY BUT PERHAPS HIS FATHER WAS ABLE TO SEE HIS GOOD INTENTIONS AS HE DID NOTHING TO HINDER HIM IN FACT NOW AND THEN HE USED THE TIP OF HIS STICK TO GIVE DIRECTIONS FROM A DISTANCE AS TO WHICH WAY TO TURN IF ONLY HIS FATHER WOULD STOP THAT UNBEARABLE HISSING IT WAS MAKING GREGOR QUITE CONFUSED WHEN HE HAD NEARLY FINISHED TURNING ROUND STILL LISTENING TO THAT HISSING HE MADE A MISTAKE AND TURNED HIMSELF BACK A LITTLE THE WAY HE HAD JUST COME HE WAS PLEASED WHEN HE FINALLY HAD HIS HEAD IN FRONT OF THE DOORWAY BUT THEN SAW THAT IT WAS TOO NARROW AND HIS BODY WAS TOO BROAD TO GET THROUGH IT WITHOUT FURTHER DIFFICULTY IN HIS PRESENT MOOD IT OBVIOUSLY DID NOT OCCUR TO HIS FATHER TO OPEN THE OTHER OF THE DOUBLE DOORS SO THAT GREGOR WOULD HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO GET THROUGH HE WAS MERELY FIXED ON THE IDEA THAT GREGOR SHOULD BE GOT BACK INTO HIS ROOM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE NOR WOULD HE EVER HAVE ALLOWED GREGOR THE TIME TO GET HIMSELF UPRIGHT AS PREPARATION FOR GETTING THROUGH THE DOORWAY WHAT HE DID MAKING MORE NOISE THAN EVER WAS TO DRIVE GREGOR FORWARDS ALL THE HARDER AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING IN THE WAY IT SOUNDED TO GREGOR AS IF THERE WAS NOW MORE THAN ONE FATHER BEHIND HIM IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE AND GREGOR PUSHED HIMSELF INTO THE DOORWAY WITHOUT REGARD FOR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN ONE SIDE OF HIS BODY LIFTED ITSELF HE LAY AT AN ANGLE IN THE DOORWAY ONE FLANK SCRAPED ON THE WHITE DOOR AND WAS PAINFULLY INJURED LEAVING VILE BROWN FLECKS ON IT SOON HE WAS STUCK FAST AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE AT ALL BY HIMSELF THE LITTLE LEGS ALONG ONE SIDE HUNG QUIVERING IN THE AIR WHILE THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE PRESSED PAINFULLY AGAINST THE GROUND THEN HIS FATHER GAVE HIM A HEFTY SHOVE FROM BEHIND WHICH RELEASED HIM FROM WHERE HE WAS HELD AND SENT HIM FLYING AND HEAVILY BLEEDING DEEP INTO HIS ROOM THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED SHUT WITH THE STICK THEN FINALLY ALL WAS QUIET
